# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to midnite are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning is **lockstep**: at any moment every package shares one
`MAJOR.MINOR`, while `PATCH` advances independently per package (so a `cli`-only
fix can ship while `web` stays put). Release sections are curated from
conventional commits via the `/release-prep` → `/release-complete` flow — and are
kept separate from the phase tracker in [`todo/done.md`](todo/done.md), which logs
build progress rather than release notes.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-19

A big login + identity release: a fully redesigned, branded sign-in experience
on a living neuro-cloud backdrop, Google/GitHub SSO end-to-end, and an
in-app update system.

### Added

- **Redesigned login** — a split-screen, branded sign-in: an animated
  **neuro-cloud** starfield backdrop (firing "thought paths", a cursor gravity
  well, and press-to-gather / release-to-scatter interaction), a typed-out hero
  wordmark + cycling marketing copy with an entry choreography, floating-label
  inputs, an email-reveal form in a frosted-glass panel, and a remembered
  "last used" sign-in method.
- **Google & GitHub SSO** — end-to-end single sign-on: gateway SSO config with a
  fail-closed boot check, identity persistence, the SSO auth flow
  (`SsoService`/`SsoController`), and first-class "Continue with Google / GitHub"
  buttons on the login + register pages.
- **Neuro-cloud everywhere** — the same starfield is now the backdrop on the
  **screensaver** and the **landing home**, not just login.
- **In-app updates** — an update banner with release notes, per-platform update
  handling, update **channels** + a force-update floor, a CLI out-of-date notice,
  a `version.json` freshness guard emitted on release, and Electron
  **auto-update + code-signing** for the desktop app.
- **Landing & header polish** — landing clock moved to top-centre with top-left
  weather; a top-right header-actions cluster + always-visible avatar; a
  restyled brand accent gradient; hover-expand control-bar buttons; search moved
  into the view control bars; collapsible settings categories; and
  status-coloured last-run badges.

### Fixed

- SSO callback made static-export compatible (unbreaks the web build).
- Login-screen polish: SSO buttons always visible, header logo, theme toggle, and
  an unauthenticated → `/login` redirect.
- Assistant "Docs" link points at the hosted docs; the Guide button plays rather
  than browsing away.

### Changed

- Docs site: hash-router link fixes, a theme dropdown, accordion navigation, and
  richer product prose.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-26

The first tagged release. The curated highlights below cover what has landed since
the initial scaffold.

### Added

- **Task board** — a kanban (`backlog → todo → wip → waiting → done → abandoned`)
  driven from a CLI and a browser, backed by a long-running Nest/Fastify gateway
  with a REST + WebSocket API that pushes live board updates.
- **Agent pool & scheduler** — a single-tick scheduler fills N slots by priority
  and age, spawning Claude Code sessions; retries on crash, run timeouts, and
  per-repo concurrency caps.
- **Browser-embedded terminals** — gateway-managed PTYs streamed to `xterm.js`
  with human-in-the-loop approvals and reconnect/reattach.
- **Smart intake** — each freeform item is classified (bug / feature / question /
  chore) and triaged to a starting column; bulk / paste add; URLs and GitHub
  issue/PR context are folded into the agent's seed prompt.
- **Repo registry** — DB-backed, CRUD-able repos that resolve a task's working
  directory, with per-repo concurrency caps and branch-prefix / PR-body
  conventions injected into the agent prompt.
- **Workflows** — a node-based builder with an expression engine, reshape /
  storage nodes, run history, live run streaming, and CLI commands; plus
  **Councils** (multi-agent deliberation) and **Brainstorms**.
- **Dashboards & office** — a visual "office" view of the agent fleet and a
  configurable widget dashboard (throughput, system health, LLM cost & usage,
  shipped PRs, activity, and market / weather / news / world-clock widgets).
- **LLM usage tracking** — per-call cost recording with optional soft budgets.
- **`@midnite/ui`** — a reusable, framework-agnostic component library and design
  tokens (with a Storybook catalog), consumed by the web app.
- **Public site** and a **desktop app** wrapping the web UI.
- **Public downloads** — each tagged release builds the desktop installers on every
  OS and publishes them to the public companion repo
  ([`bilo-io/midnite-app`](https://github.com/bilo-io/midnite-app)), so per-platform
  builds (macOS arm64/x64 `.dmg`, Windows x64 `.exe`, Linux x64 `.AppImage`) download
  straight from the site while the source repo stays private.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Initial moon/pnpm monorepo scaffold — `shared`, `gateway`, `cli`, `web`, `ui`,
  `site`, and `desktop` packages, the proto + moon toolchain, `moon ci`, and the
  one-way package-boundary graph (`shared` is the contract).
